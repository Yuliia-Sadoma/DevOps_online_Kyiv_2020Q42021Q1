# Module 2 Virtualization and Cloud Basic

## Task 2.1

### PART 1. HYPERVISORS

#### 1. What are the most popular hypervisors for infrastructure virtualization?

* VMware vSphere
* Microsoft Hyper-V
* Azure Virtual Machines 
* Oracle VM

#### 2. Briefly describe the main differences of the most popular hypervisors.

There are two types of hypervisors:
* Type 1 Hypervisor (also called bare metal or native)
* Type 2 Hypervisor (also known as hosted hypervisors)

The main difference between Type 1 and Type 2 Hypervisor is that Type 1 Hypervisor runs directly on the hostâ€™s hardware while Type 2 Hypervisor runs on an operating system similar to other computer programs.
